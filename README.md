  <p><strong>Building a cute digital garden.</strong></p>
</div>

  This is a tool that generates a static website out of my notes. The idea originates from the concept of **digital gardens**. To summarize: A digital garden is a personal space online where you can share and develop your ideas, it tends to be way less structured as a traditional blog.

  > It's called a garden because it is a lot more iterative then a traditional blog. Like a real garden you need to maintain regularly, a digital garden also encourages you to revisit and refine ideas over a prolonged period of time.
